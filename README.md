# mysql-bootstrap-pagination
Convert a MySQL table into a sortable HTML table using Bootstrap (CSS), JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP.

All instances of the word "example" need to be replaced with the proper header/context for your database/project. By default, everything is running through format-content.php. This can be considered the index file.

This custom table/pagination was built for kfdatabase.com.
